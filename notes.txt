--Recent Projects Blog --
es — perfect idea.

Placing a “Recent Projects” section right before the client logos is strategically smart:

✅ Leads naturally from “Here’s what we do” → “Here’s what we’ve done”

✅ Creates a nice scroll climax before wrapping with social proof (client logos)

✅ Feels like a mini-portfolio or blog highlight

✅ Keeps homepage dynamic without stealing focus from your full “Work” page

💡 Section Title Ideas
Instead of just "Recent Projects", go with something a bit more stylish or branded:

Recent Work

Selected Projects

Our Latest Creations

Fresh from the Studio

Designs We're Proud Of

🎨 Layout (3 Project Cards)
Each card could include:

Thumbnail (image)

Project title

Category / tags (e.g., Branding, UI/UX)

Short one-line description

Optional hover effect or "View Case" button
